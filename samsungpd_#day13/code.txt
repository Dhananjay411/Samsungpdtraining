The Full-Adder output as discussed for the pre-synthesis simulation matches with the post-simulation output.The following are the sequnece of steps for simulating the output.

iverilog full_add_net.v tb_add4.v primitives.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_full_add_4.vcd
The iverilog command uses the simulated gatelevel netlist and the same testbench for post-synthesis simulation. The ./a.out dumps the vcd format file with respect to netlist. The gtkwave is used to view the waveform. The post-simulation output is as follows:



So, The output of post-synthesis and pre-synthesis exactly matches so the logical corectness of the design is verified.

The inputs a and b are given to each full adder and the carry from previous stage is given as input to the next stage. The following sequence of commands writes the netlist and ddc format as follows:

read_verilog add4.v
link
compile_ultra
write -f verilog -out full_add_net.v
write -f ddc -out full_add.ddc
The read_db command is not used as the target_library and link_library are previously set to sky130 technology .db. The schematic of the full-adder can be viewed as follows:


The commands used for generating the out netlist are as follows:

read_verilog mythcore_test.v
link
compile_ultra
write -f verilog -out rvmyth_net.v
The netlist being written here as out is the output of the clk_gate as it is default in code. So, the current_design is changed to core and the netlist is written out as follows:

current_design core
write -f verilog -out rvmyth_net.v
The processor output increments in the same way as at the pre-synthesis stage, So, the logic is properly defined. The following commands are used to simulate the output waveform.

iverilog -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 rvmyth_net.v tb_mythcore_test.v primitives.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_mythcore_test.vcd
The post-synthesis of the BabySoC is as follows:

The following commands are used to simulate the output waveform.

iverilog -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 rvmyth_net.v testbench.v primitives.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v avsddac.v avsdpll.v vsdbabysoc.v
./a.out

In Digital System Circuit, an Encoder is a combinational circuit that takes 2n  input signal lines and encodes them into n output signal lines. When the enable is true i.e., the corresponding input signal lines display the equivalent binary bit output. 

For example, 8:3 Encoder has 8 input lines and 3 output lines, 4:2 Encoder has 4 input lines and 2 output lines, and so on. 

 An 8:3 Priority Encoder has seven input lines i.e., i0 to i7, and three output lines y2, y1, and y0. In 8:3 Priority Encoder i7 have the highest priority and i0 the lowest. 



Most of the programming deals with software development and design but Verilog HDL is a hardware description language that is used to design electronics design. Verilog provides designers to design the devices based on different levels of abstraction that include: Gate Level, Data Flow, Switch Level, and Behavioral modeling. 

Behavior Modeling:
Behavioral Model which is the highest level of abstraction, Since we are using Behavioral Modeling we shall write the code using if-else to ensure the Priority Encoder input values. By using the if condition the output values are assigned based on the priority.
