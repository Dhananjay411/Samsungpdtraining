##Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
	 
 **RTL**:  Register Transfer Level is a method of describing what happens to data as it is transferred from one register (or state holding device) to another. the designer should specify how the data flows between the registers and how the design processes the data.
 

 
**Testbench**: it is a code module that describes the stimulus to a logic design and checks whether the design's outputs match its              specification. it is used for the verification of the digital hardware design. verification required to ensure the design meets the timing and  funcationality requirements. it is used to simulate and analyze designs without the need for any physical hardware or any hardware device. the  most important advantage of this is that you can inspect every signal/ variable (reg, wire in verilog) in the design. 

**Simulator**: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs.
 It is a design abstraction that models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the data flow between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. In RTL code we write code for combinational and sequential circuits like that of HDL, and VHDL.
 The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

 <summary>Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave</summary>

 We performed all the lab examples on the Linux operating system.

 **Iverilog**: Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language compiler that generates netlists in the desired format (EDIF). It supports the 1995, 2001 and 2005 versions of the standard, portions of SystemVerilog, and some extensions.

 **Gtkwave**: GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix, Win32, and Mac OSX which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

 We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice. 

 Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog. 
 
 The syntax of the code is: iverilog RTL_design_code Testbench

 <summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

 **Synthesis**: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

 **Yosys** : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

**Verification of synthesized design** : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

**Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells** :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power. Narrow transistors are other way around. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit. Keeping in view of previous observations of faster vs slower cells,to avoid hold time violations, larger circuits, sluggish circuits, we offer guidance to synthesizer in the form of Constraints.

<summary>Labs on Yosys </summary>
 We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX. 
 
 **Procedure** : First we need to read the liberty file using the code
 
 **read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 Then we need read the RTL Design code

 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 After this we need to perform synthesis 

 **synth -top <instance_name>**
 
 generating netlist

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form using the **show** command
